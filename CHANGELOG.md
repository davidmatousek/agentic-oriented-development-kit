## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-08

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### AOD Rebranding — Renamed .specify/ to .aod/ and Replaced All Spec Kit Branding

The project has been rebranded from "Product-Led Spec Kit" to "Agentic Oriented Development Kit" (AOD Kit). This is a comprehensive rename affecting directory structure, branding text, and file names across the repository.

**Structural Changes:**
- `.specify/` directory renamed to `.aod/` (git history preserved via `git mv`)
- `docs/SPEC_KIT_TRIAD.md` renamed to `docs/AOD_TRIAD.md`
- Environment variables: `SPECIFY_FEATURE` → `AOD_FEATURE`, `SPECIFY_DIR` → `AOD_DIR`
- Log prefixes: `[specify]` → `[aod]`

**Branding Replacements:**
- `Product-Led Spec Kit` → `Agentic Oriented Development Kit`
- `SPEC_KIT` → `AOD` (constant-case identifiers)
- `Spec Kit` → `AOD Kit` (user-facing text)
- `spec-kit` → `aod` (kebab-case identifiers)
- All `spec-kit-ops` upstream references removed from active files

**Preserved:**
- `/triad.specify` command name (unchanged — "specify" is a verb, not branding)
- Historical specs (001-007) and their artifacts
- Historical planning documents and prior CHANGELOG entries
- Private GitHub repository name (`product-led-spec-kit`)

**Migration**: Update any local scripts or documentation referencing `.specify/` paths to `.aod/`. Update any references to `docs/SPEC_KIT_TRIAD.md` to `docs/AOD_TRIAD.md`.

### Added - 3 New Thinking Lenses (Feature 009)

Added three new structured thinking lenses to `docs/core_principles/` and updated the thinking-lens skill:

- **Four Causes** (`four_causes.md`) - Aristotelian causal analysis examining Material, Formal, Efficient, and Final causes to understand why something exists or happens
- **Cargo Cult Detection** (`cargo_cult_detection.md`) - Identifies practices copied without understanding, helping teams distinguish genuine best practices from superficial mimicry
- **Golden Mean** (`golden_mean.md`) - Aristotelian balance-finding framework for navigating engineering trade-offs between extremes

**Details:**
- Content-only addition (no code, API, or infrastructure changes)
- Updated `docs/core_principles/README.md` lens registry with all three lenses
- Updated `.claude/skills/thinking-lens/SKILL.md` to reference new lenses
- PR: [#8](https://github.com/davidmatousek/product-led-spec-kit/pull/8)
- Tasks completed: 26/26

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-07

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### SpecKit Commands Removed — Unified Triad Workflow

All `/speckit.*` commands have been removed and consolidated into the `/triad.*` command set. The dual command architecture (Triad + Vanilla) has been replaced with a single, unified workflow.

**Command Mapping:**

| Former Command | New Command | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| `/speckit.specify` | `/triad.specify` | Logic inlined with research + PM sign-off |
| `/speckit.plan` | `/triad.plan` | Logic inlined with PM + Architect sign-off |
| `/speckit.tasks` | `/triad.tasks` | Logic inlined with triple sign-off |
| `/speckit.implement` | `/triad.implement` | Logic inlined with Architect checkpoints |
| `/speckit.clarify` | `/triad.clarify` | Direct transfer with reference updates |
| `/speckit.analyze` | `/triad.analyze` | Direct transfer with reference updates |
| `/speckit.checklist` | `/triad.checklist` | Direct transfer with reference updates |
| `/speckit.constitution` | `/triad.constitution` | Direct transfer with reference updates |

**Migration**: Replace all `/speckit.*` commands with their `/triad.*` equivalents. No other changes needed.

### Added
- 4 new triad commands: `/triad.clarify`, `/triad.analyze`, `/triad.checklist`, `/triad.constitution`
- Archive tag `v2.0.0-pre-speckit-removal` preserves historical state

### Removed
- All 8 `/speckit.*` command files
- "Vanilla Commands" sections from all documentation
- `compatible_with_speckit` and `last_tested_with_speckit` frontmatter from all command files

### Changed
- 4 core triad commands now self-contained (no Skill tool coupling to speckit commands)
- All documentation, rules, skills, and agents reference only `/triad.*` commands
- CLAUDE.md updated with unified command set (10 triad commands)
- Renamed `speckit-validator` skill to `spec-validator` (removes speckit branding)

**New Skill**
- Added thinking-lens skill for structured analysis methodologies

**Key Metrics**
- Tasks completed: 140
- Total agent line reduction: 58% (7,885 → ~3,300 lines)
