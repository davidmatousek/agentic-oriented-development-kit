## Documented Patterns

### Pattern: Atomic File Write

**Added**: Feature 022 (Full Lifecycle Orchestrator)
**ADR**: [ADR-001](../02_ADRs/ADR-001-atomic-state-persistence.md)

#### Problem
Writing JSON state to disk risks corruption if the process crashes mid-write. Readers may see partial JSON, breaking the orchestrator's ability to resume.

#### Solution
Write to a temporary file first, then atomically rename it to the target path. On POSIX systems, `mv` within the same filesystem is atomic.

#### Example
```bash
# From .aod/scripts/bash/run-state.sh
AOD_STATE_FILE=".aod/run-state.json"
AOD_STATE_TMP=".aod/run-state.json.tmp"

aod_state_write() {
    local json="$1"
    # Validate JSON before writing
    echo "$json" | jq . > "$AOD_STATE_TMP" || { rm -f "$AOD_STATE_TMP"; return 1; }
    # Atomic rename
    mv "$AOD_STATE_TMP" "$AOD_STATE_FILE"
}
```

#### When to Use
- Writing state/config files that must survive crashes
- Any file where partial writes would corrupt consumers
- Single-writer scenarios (no concurrent access needed)

#### When NOT to Use
- Multi-writer concurrent scenarios (use file locking or a database)
- Append-only logs (just append, no need for atomicity on the whole file)

---

### Pattern: Function Library Sourcing

**Added**: Pre-Feature 022, documented during Feature 022

#### Problem
Bash scripts that define functions are invoked as standalone executables (`bash script.sh arg`), but the functions are never called -- only defined.

#### Solution
Source the library file before calling its functions. Use `bash -c 'source lib.sh && function_name args'`.

#### Example
```bash
# CORRECT: source then call
bash -c 'source .aod/scripts/bash/run-state.sh && aod_state_read'
bash -c 'source .aod/scripts/bash/github-lifecycle.sh && aod_gh_update_stage 22 plan'

# WRONG: functions defined but never called
bash .aod/scripts/bash/run-state.sh aod_state_read
```

**Exception**: `backlog-regenerate.sh` is a standalone script (not a function library):
```bash
bash .aod/scripts/bash/backlog-regenerate.sh
```

#### When to Use
- All `.aod/scripts/bash/*.sh` function libraries
- Any Bash file that exports functions rather than running a main block

#### When NOT to Use
- Standalone scripts with a `main` block or top-level logic

---

### Pattern: Graceful CLI Degradation

**Added**: Feature 022 (Full Lifecycle Orchestrator)

#### Problem
The orchestrator depends on `gh` CLI for GitHub Issue label management, but `gh` may not be installed, authenticated, or the network may be unavailable. Hard-failing would block the entire lifecycle.

#### Solution
Check CLI availability before use, and fall back to artifact-only detection when the CLI is unavailable. Non-critical operations (label updates, backlog refresh) are fire-and-forget.

#### Example
```bash
# Check availability, skip silently if missing
if command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1 && gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    gh issue view "$NNN" --json labels
else
    echo "GitHub CLI unavailable. Falling back to artifact-only detection."
    # Infer stage from on-disk artifacts instead
fi

# Fire-and-forget for non-critical operations
bash .aod/scripts/bash/backlog-regenerate.sh 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### When to Use
- External CLI tools that may not be installed (gh, jq, docker)
- Network-dependent operations where offline mode should still work
- Non-critical side effects (label updates, notifications)

#### When NOT to Use
- Core dependencies that the feature cannot function without (e.g., `jq` for JSON state)
